When standard Javascript functions are invoked, they run until they return a value or reach the end of the function. At that point, they’re finished. ES6 introduces a new type of function called generators.

### A generator is a special type of function that can be entered and exited a number of times. You might hear people describe it as, 
 “a function that can be paused”.

The only difference so far is that the generator function is defined with `function*` rather than the standard `function.`


`.next()`

`yield`
